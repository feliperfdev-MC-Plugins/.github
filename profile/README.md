## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've created this organization here on Github just to store some of my Minecraft Plugins side-projects that MOSTLY are made for fun. So, they aren't projects that actually would work on your machine (at least this is something I can try in the future), but the main focus here is just to learn and put in practive things I've learned during my journey as a developer.

This skills includes:

- Developing with Dart language (I'm trying to apply somethings using Shelf package to a backend service)
- MySQL connection (And I'm connecting with it using a Dart package too â€” [check it out in the project pubspec.yaml](https://github.com/feliperfdev-MC-Plugins/cherry-craft-api/blob/main/pubspec.yaml))
- Developing with Kotlin language (My real goal is to learn Jetpack compose for mobile developing, but I'm trying to increase my knowledge in the language sintax and package managers like Maven)
  - Also I'm using Retrofit2 to connect with my Dart Backend service

The projects (both are part of the "same" project â€” the development of a Minecraft plugin):

> To give a context: I just tried to create a plugin that connects with a Database (MySQL) and interacts with a whole command list that I coded in Kotlin using Bukkit/Spigot.

> `cherrycraft` is just a fictional name I gave to "my" Minecraft Server (it only works **locally**)
